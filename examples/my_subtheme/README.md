# USWDS Subtheme

## Installation

1. Copy this folder ("my_subtheme") out into the desired location for your subtheme (eg, sites/all/themes/custom/my_subtheme).
2. Rename the folder to the name of your theme (eg, my_renamed_theme).
3. Rename the my_subtheme.info.rename-me file to name-of-your-theme.info (eg, my_renamed_theme.info).
4. Tweak that .info file as needed, noting the instructions there for Sass workflow, if that is desired.
5. Enable this theme in the usual way (eg, drush en my_renamed_subtheme).

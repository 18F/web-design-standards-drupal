# U.S. Web Design Standards â€“ Drupal theme

**Current status:** very much a work in progress. Branches are being developed simultaneously for Drupal 7 and 8. For further details, see the [waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/18F/web-design-standards-drupal).

**Background:**
As of 2012, an estimated 24 percent of U.S. government websites (including whitehouse.gov, most famously) were Drupal sites. That number has only continued to increase.

Just as the [Bootstrap](http://drupal.org/project/bootstrap) theme bridges the gap between Drupal and the [Bootstrap Framework](http://getbootstrap.com), a USWDS theme will make it simpler and easier for Drupal site administrators to use the U.S. Web Design Standards. A Drupal 8 version of the theme will additionally make it easier for site administrators to update to this major new version of Drupal.
